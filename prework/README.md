# Code 301 Pre-work: Intermediate Software Development

To get your laptop and yourself ready for the start of Code 301, there are a series of pre-work tasks to complete.

Before completing the tasks in this document, ensure that you have completed all of the installation tasks in the [Code 201 Prework](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/prework/){:target="_blank"}.

In particular, if you have tested in to Code 301 and did not take Code 201, be especially attentive to the git and GitHub portion of the Code 201 prework. Note that your future classmates who took 201 will already have a month of practice using git and GitHub; it is a common area of challenge in 301 for students who tested in to the course.

Note that the tasks below have a corresponding assignment to submit in your Canvas course, but be aware that at the time you receive the link to this pre-work that the Canvas course may not yet be published, depending upon the timing of Admissions processes and when class begins. Typically, Canvas courses are published 5-7 days before class begins.
