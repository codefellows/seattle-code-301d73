# Mongo, Mongoose and Data Modeling

## Overview

Today is all about persistence. We will introduce Mongodb and Mongoose. We will create data models and hard code some data to store in our database so that our front end can retrieve that data. We will introduce `CRUD` and focus on the `R`:`READ`.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
